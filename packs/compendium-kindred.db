The recipient of the vampire&rsquo;s Beast is instantly overcome by frenzy. This is an unnatural frenzy, however, as the victim is channeling the Kindred&rsquo;s own fury.

Botching this roll is even more catastrophic; the heightened frenzy grows so extreme that not even expending Willpower curbs its duration or effects.

Wood slats, blacktop, even artificial turf blocks Earth Meld&rsquo;s effectiveness &mdash; then again, it&rsquo;s a relatively simple matter for a vampire at this level of power to grow claws and rip apart enough of the flooring to expose the raw soil beneath.<br><br>By interring himself in the ground, the vampire gains full protection from daylight when outdoors. It is also the method of choice for those Kindred who wish to sleep away the centuries; these vampires lock themselves in the earth&rsquo;s embrace, gaining strength and power as they rest. Superstitious and paranoid Kindred whisper that thousands of Ancients sleep within the ground and will awaken when Gehenna arrives.<br><br>While so interred, the vampire is in a transitional state between flesh and earth. His physical presence exists between the physical world and the astral plane. As such, the vampire is difficult to sense, even through supernatural means. However, a disruption to the soil that the immortal occupies, or to his presence on the astral realm, returns him immediately to the physical world (and to full wakefulness), showering dirt outward as his body displaces the soil.</p>","details":"<p>No roll is necessary, although the character must spend a blood point. Sinking into the earth is automatic and takes a turn to complete. The character falls into a state one step above torpor during this time, sensing his surroundings only distantly. The player must make a Humanity or Path roll (difficulty 6) for the character to rouse himself in response to danger prior to his desired time of emergence.<br><br>Since the character is in an in-between state, any attempts to locate him (catching his scent, scanning for his aura, traveling astrally, and so on) are made at +2 difficulty. Astral individuals cannot affect the vampire directly, instead meeting with a kind of spongy resistance as their hands pass through him. Similarly, digging in the material world encounters incredibly hardpacked earth, virtually as dense as stone.<br><br>Attempts at violence upon the submerged vampire from either side return him to his physical nature, expelling the soil with which he bonded in a blinding spray (all Perception-based rolls are at +2 difficulty for the turn). The character himself subtracts two from his initiative for the first turn after his restoration, due to momentary disorientation.

The vampire creates an empathic connection with a beast, thereby allowing him to communicate or issue simple commands. The Kindred locks eyes with the animal, transmitting his desires through sheer force of will. Although it isn&rsquo;t necessary to actually &ldquo;speak&rdquo; in chirps, hisses, or barks, some vampires find that doing so helps strengthen the connection with the animal. Eye contact must be maintained the entire time; if it&rsquo;s broken, the Kindred must re-establish contact to continue communication.<br><br></p>\n<p>The simpler the creature, the more difficult it becomes to connect with the animal&rsquo;s Beast. Mammals, predatory birds, and larger reptiles are relatively easy to communicate with. Insects, invertebrates, and most fish are just too simple to connect with.<br><br></p>\n<p>Feral Whispers provides no guarantees that an animal will want to deal with the vampire, nor does it ensure that the animal will pursue any requests the vampire makes of it. Still, it does at least make the creature better disposed toward the Kindred. The manner in which the vampire presents his desires to the animal often depends on the type of creature. A Kindred can often bully smaller beasts into heeding commands, but he&rsquo;s better off couching orders for large predators as requests.<br><br></p>\n<p>If the vampire successfully uses the power, the animal performs the command to the best of its ability and intellect. Only the very brightest creatures understand truly complex directives (orders dealing with conditional situations or requiring abstract logic). Commands that the animal does understand remain deeply implanted, however, and guide its behavior for some time.</p>","details":"<p>No roll is necessary to talk with an animal, but the character must establish eye contact (see p. 152) first. Issuing commands requires a Manipulation + Animal Ken roll. The difficulty depends on the creature: Predatory mammals (wolves, cats, vampire bats) are difficulty 6, other mammals and predatory birds (rats, owls) are difficulty 7, and other birds and reptiles (pigeons, snakes) are difficulty 8. This difficulty is reduced by one if the character speaks to the animal in its &ldquo;native tongue,&rdquo; and can be adjusted further by circumstances and roleplaying skill (we highly recommend that all communication between characters and animals be roleplayed).<br><br></p>\n<p>The number of successes the player achieves dictates how strongly the character&rsquo;s command affects the animal. One success is sufficient to have a cat follow an individual and lead the character to the same location, three successes are enough to have a raven spy on a target for weeks, and five successes ensure that a grizzly ferociously guards the entrance to the character&rsquo;s wilderness haven for some months.<br><br>The character&rsquo;s Nature plays a large part in how he approaches these conversations. The character might try intimidating, teasing, cajoling, or rationalizing. The player should understand that he does not simply play his character in these situations, but the Beast Within as well.<br><br></p>\n<p>Using this power cannot force an animal to do something against its nature, or to force a creature to risk its life. While the aforementioned grizzly would stand guard to the vampire&rsquo;s haven and even fight for it, it would not do so against obviously superior numbers or something overwhelmingly supernatural. A predatory bird might be convinced to harry a target, but would definitely not hold ground. A docile dog or skittish cat would have no problem with reporting something it had seen, but it wouldn&rsquo;t enter combat unless given no other option &mdash; though it would likely agree to stand and fight and then flee at the first opportunity, if a harsh Kindred demanded it.</p>","type":"wod.types.disciplinepower","level":"1","value":0,"max":5,"dice1":"manipulation","dice2":"animalken","bonus":0,"difficulty":"-1","isrollable":true,"isactive":false,"spendwillpower":false,"spendrage":false,"spendgnosis":false,"spendblood":false,"spendglamour":false},"effects":[],"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_iu0zv3lhu5i","path":"Disciplines#/CF_SEP/Animalism","color":"#000000"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldofdarkness","systemVersion":"2.2.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1670224311518,"modifiedTime":1674221156410,"lastModifiedBy":"CZyj5tVpsqRvDFFc"},"_id":"HcYpWCOUPKDgvVex","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"CZyj5tVpsqRvDFFc":3}}

The necromancer simply speaks five syllables. No one can identify the casting language, but according to the ritual&rsquo;s oblique history, the language is what God gave humankind before the confusion of Babel. The legend further states that while the particular meaning of the words is lost, they are what Caine&rsquo;s father said to him while exiling him to Nod.<br><br>Regardless of the truth of the matter, the Words of Exile are not spoken lightly. When the ritual is cast successfully, it opens a hole within reality itself &mdash; a rip between the lands of the living and the darkest depths of the Underworld. This tear is invisible to normal vision, but to Witness of Death or Shroudsight it looks like a black vortex opening within the vampire&rsquo;s own body (the very few unfortunate enough to look into the gap with high levels of Auspex are generally unwilling or unable to discuss it). Any ghost clutched to the Kindred&rsquo;s chest is instantly torn to shreds. Grabbing a ghost in this fashion requires a Clinch or Tackle maneuver. Destroyed spirits don&rsquo;t come back for at least a month, if ever. A wraith destroyed in this fashion tends to return as a Spectre, if it returns at all.<br><br>The necromancer may clutch and destroy a number of spirits equal to the number of successes she rolled. After that, the vortex closes. It closes at the end of the scene if it hasn&rsquo;t already.<br><br>Of course, using one&rsquo;s body as a portal between our world and what some people might call Hell is neither simple nor healthy. For starters, it costs a blood point and a point of Willpower (which does not give an automatic success on the ritual roll). More importantly, each success rolled inflicts a level of unsoakable lethal damage on the necromancer. Most significantly, every use of <em>Esilio</em> permanently reduces the necromancer&rsquo;s Humanity by one point if he follows that morality, and may impact other Paths at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion.</p>","details":"<p>Casting times for necromantic rituals vary widely; see the description for particulars.

This cloud of virulence is completely invisible to anyone without the ability to see the passing of entropy. The energy of this cloud is like a beacon for Spectres, and they are drawn to the entropic force like moths to a flame.<br><br>Once the energy is pulled from the necromancer&rsquo;s body, she can either disperse it over a large area as a lure for Spectres, or use the mist for more sinister purposes. Channeled into an object or person, the deathmist inflicts the subject with a debilitating, wasting illness. Furthermore, the focused energies are tainted and eerie, and though generally invisible (except to powers such as Aura Perception), they tend to cause people and animals to feel uncomfortable around the victim.</p>","details":"<p>The player spends one blood point and rolls Willpower (difficulty 8). Only one success is needed to draw out the Breath of Thanatos. If dispersed to summon Spectres, the energies cover roughly one-quarter of a mile (400 meters) in radius, centered around the necromancer. The range increases by an additional one-quarter mile or 400 meters for every additional blood point expended.<br><br>Spectres summoned with this power will ignore the summoning necromancer for the duration of the power unless provoked, but may well go out of their way to wreak havoc on anyone else in the vicinity. The necromancer can then use other Necromancy powers (such as those in the Sepulchre Path) to manipulate and affect these Spectres. Ghosts so targeted may then interact with the necromancer as normal, although the other Spectres in the area will continue to ignore both the vampire and the targeted ghost. This energy disperses after a scene, after which the Spectres leave to find new prey. Mechanics for Spectres can be found on p. 385.<br><br>If the cloud is directed toward a particular target, the necromancer must either touch the target or direct the stream of entropy using Dexterity + Occult (difficulty 7). A target laden with entropy suffers one (and only one) level of aggravated damage; this generally manifests as sudden illness or decay. The target&rsquo;s social difficulties while interacting with those unfamiliar with the touch of death &mdash; most normal humans, as well as some supernatural creatures &mdash; increase by 2. Furthermore, supernatural perceptions indicate the target is tainted with decay, which can be dangerous. This form of taint lasts until sunrise; a victim already plagued by this power cannot be affected again until the previous fog of entropy has dispersed.<br><br>A botch on the roll to control this power indicates that the vampire has turned the energy upon himself, and suffers all the effects of the vitriolic breath.

This represents the most damage that this power can inflict in a single night regardless of successes, but a target who has lost all of her Willpower dots through use of Dagon&rsquo;s Call on successive nights is reduced to a mindless husk.<br><br>As with the warrior version, the Assamite need not be within the target&rsquo;s presence to trigger this attack.<br><br><br><em><strong>Original - Warrior Version:</strong></em><br>The vampire must touch her target prior to using Dagon&rsquo;s Call.

The Kindred&rsquo;s player makes a contested Stamina roll against the target&rsquo;s Stamina; the difficulty of each roll is equal to the opponent&rsquo;s permanent Willpower rating. The number of successes the vampire using Dagon&rsquo;s Call achieves is the amount of lethal damage, in health levels, the victim suffers. For an additional point of Willpower spent in the next turn, the vampire may continue using Dagon&rsquo;s Call by engaging in another contested Stamina roll. So long as the Kindred&rsquo;s player continues to spend Willpower, the character may continue rending her opponent from within.</p>","type":"wod.types.disciplinepower","level":"3","value":0,"max":5,"dice1":"stamina","dice2":"","bonus":0,"difficulty":"-1","isrollable":true,"isactive":false,"spendwillpower":false,"spendrage":false,"spendgnosis":false,"spendblood":false,"spendglamour":false},"effects":[],"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_u1wajwfwbf","path":"Disciplines#/CF_SEP/Quietus#/CF_SEP/Quietus (Sorcerer)","color":"#000000"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldofdarkness","systemVersion":"2.2.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1670332666414,"modifiedTime":1674221183079,"lastModifiedBy":"CZyj5tVpsqRvDFFc"},"_id":"TqIPmjRHbcbwU46y","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"CZyj5tVpsqRvDFFc":3}}

If the character is drawing the energies from the atmosphere, she must be in a place where death has occurred within the hour or in a place where death is common, such as a cemetery, a morgue, or the scene of a recent murder. Generally, the necromancer can draw anywhere from one to four points of entropy from such a location, although the difficulty in using all Necromancy and similar deathly powers within the area increases by an equal amount for a number of nights equal to the points taken. The energies of such an area may only be drained once until the area&rsquo;s entropy replenishes.<br><br>In cases when the necromancer feeds on a ghost, the vampire must actually attack the wraith as if feeding normally. Wraiths have up to 10 &ldquo;blood points&rdquo; that may be taken from them, and they become less and less substantial as their spirit essence drains away. The character is vulnerable to any attack the ghost might make, even those that do not normally affect the physical world; while feeding, the vampire is essentially in a half-state, existing in both the living lands and the Underworld simultaneously. The wraith so attacked is considered immobilized and cannot run or escape unless it can defeat the vampire in a resisted Willpower roll (difficulty 6 for both sides).

Blood from a cold corpse has been transubstantiated into a dead form &mdash; a cold incarnation of a hot, wet element. This transformation of the living into death holds great power; the necromancer knows how to infuse her own being with the blood of a cold corpse and transform herself into something not wholly vampiric.

The Tremere Clan is best known for their possession (and jealous hoarding) of this Discipline. The Tremere created Thaumaturgy by combining mortal wizardry with the power of vampiric vitae, and as a result it is a versatile and powerful Discipline. Although there are whispers of the existence of Tremere antitribu in the Sabbat, other Clans in the Sword of Caine have also researched and developed access to such mystical might. Nevertheless, the Tremere of the Camarilla remain this Discipline&rsquo;s masters.<br><br>Like Necromancy, the practice of Thaumaturgy is divided into paths and rituals. Thaumaturgical paths are applications of the vampire&rsquo;s knowledge of blood magic, allowing her to create effects on a whim. Rituals are more formulaic in nature, most akin to ancient magical &ldquo;spells.&rdquo; Because so many different paths and rituals are available to the arcane Tremere, one never knows what to expect when confronted with a practitioner of this Discipline.<br><br>When a character first learns Thaumaturgy, the player selects a path for the character. That path is considered the character&rsquo;s primary path, and she automatically receives one dot in it, as well as one Level One ritual. Thereafter, whenever the character increases her level in Thaumaturgy, her rating in the primary path increases by one as well. Additional rituals are learned separately, as part of a story; players need not pay experience points for their characters to learn rituals up to the level equal to their overall rating in Thaumaturgy, though they must find someone to teach the rituals in question. Path ratings never exceed 5, though the overall Thaumaturgy score may. If a character reaches a rating of 5 in her primary path and increases her Thaumaturgy score afterward, she may allocate her &ldquo;free&rdquo; path dot to a different path. (Experience costs are covered on p. 124.)<br><br>Many Kindred fear crossing the practitioners of Thaumaturgy. It is a very potent and mutable Discipline, and almost anything the Kindred wishes may be accomplished through its magic.</p>","details":"<h2>Thaumaturgical Paths</h2>\n<p>Paths define the types of magic a vampire can perform. A vampire typically learns his primary path from his sire, though it is not unknown for some vampires to study under many different tutors.<br><br>As mentioned before, the first path a character learns is considered her primary path and increases automatically as the character advances in the Discipline itself. Secondary paths may be learned once the character has acquired two or more dots in her primary path, and they must be raised separately with experience points. Furthermore, a character&rsquo;s rating in her primary path must always be at least one dot higher than any of her secondary paths until she has mastered her primary path. Once the character has achieved the fifth level of her primary path, secondary paths may be increased to that level.<br><br>Each time the character invokes one of the powers of a Thaumaturgical path, the thaumaturge&rsquo;s player must spend a blood point and make a Willpower roll against a difficulty equal to the power&rsquo;s level +3. Only one success is required to invoke a path&rsquo;s effect &mdash; path levels, not successes, govern the power of blood magic. Failure on this roll indicates that the magic fails. A botch causes some kind of loss or catastrophic backfire, such as losing a Willpower point (or dot!), spontaneous combustion, or accidentally letting a living statue run rampant. Thaumaturgy is an unforgiving art.<br><br>Various Sects and Clans have different access to each path, but unless the Storyteller decides otherwise, it is assumed the Tremere have some access to all of them. (&ldquo;Having access&rdquo; does not mean the same thing as &ldquo;easily gained,&rdquo; especially within the Tremere power structure.) The paths start with one of the most common (The Path of Blood), and thereafter are presented in alphabetical order.

Gaining complete control over a subject&rsquo;s mind is no small task, taking weeks or even months to accomplish.<br><br>Kindred often fill their retainers&rsquo; heads with subtle whispers and veiled urges, thereby ensuring these mortals&rsquo; loyalty.

Conditioning is an extended action, for which the Storyteller secretly determines the number of successes required. It typically requires between five and 10 times the subject&rsquo;s Self-Control/Instinct rating. Targets with more empathic Natures may require a lower number of successes, while those with willful Natures require a higher total.

Once the vampire accumulates half the required number of successes, the Storyteller may apply a lower difficulty to the vampire&rsquo;s subsequent uses of Dominate. After being conditioned, the target falls so far under the vampire&rsquo;s influence that the Kindred need not make eye contact or even be present to retain absolute control. The subject does exactly as she is told (including taking actions that would injure herself), as long as her master can communicate with her verbally. No command roll is necessary unless the subject is totally isolated from the vampire&rsquo;s presence (in a different room, over the phone). Even if a command roll fails, the target will still likely carry out part of the orders given, simply because her master wishes it.<br><br>After the subject is fully conditioned, other Kindred find her more difficult to Dominate. Such conditioning raises others&rsquo; difficulties by two (to a maximum of 10).<br><br>It is possible, though difficult, to shake Conditioning. The subject must be separated entirely from the vampire to whom she was in thrall. This period of separation varies depending on the individual, but the Storyteller may set it at six months, less a number of weeks equal to the subject&rsquo;s permanent Willpower rating (so a person with 5 Willpower must stay away from the vampire for just under five months). The subject regains her personality slowly during this time, though she may still lapse into brief spells of listlessness, despair, or even anger. If the vampire encounters the target before that time passes, a single successful Charisma + Leadership roll (difficulty of the target&rsquo;s current Willpower points) on the part of the vampire completely reasserts the dominance.<br><br>If the subject makes it through the time period without intervention by her master, the target regains her former individuality. Even so, the vampire may reestablish conditioning more easily than the first time, since the subject is now predisposed to falling under the Kindred&rsquo;s mental control.

No roll is necessary to activate this power, but one blood point is consumed per hit.

For this reason, many vampires choose to coat their weapons with a significant quantity of blood.

An Obfuscated vampire doesn&rsquo;t actually become invisible, however &mdash; rather, he is able to delude observers into believing that he has vanished. Obfuscate also allows Kindred to change their features and conceal other people or objects. Typically vampires using Obfuscate must be within a short range of their witnesses (approximately five yards or meters per dot of Wits + Stealth) for their power to be effective.<br><br>Unless the Kindred chooses to make herself seen, she can remain obscured for as long as she wills it. At higher levels, the vampire can actually fade from sight so subtly that those nearby can&rsquo;t actually recall the moment at which she left.<br><br>Usually, few mortals or supernaturals (even those trained in Awareness) can pierce through the fog of Obfuscate. Animals, who rely more on their instincts than their normal senses, can sometime perceive (and be frightened by) the vampire&rsquo;s presence. Children and those to whom deception is foreign may also be able to pierce the illusion, at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion. Finally, the Auspex Discipline enables Kindred to see through Obfuscate. Even that is not guaranteed, however; refer to &ldquo;Seeing the Unseen,&rdquo; p. 142, for more details. (Storytellers needing a die roll for animals or children can use this quick and dirty guideline: treat them as if they had Auspex 1 in terms of contesting Obfuscate. They do not have the Auspex 1 power, but are considered to have it when determining whether a vampire is noticed.)<br><br>Since Obfuscate clouds the mind of the viewer, vampires can&rsquo;t use it to hide their presence from electronic or mechanical devices. Video and photo cameras, for example, capture the vampire&rsquo;s image accurately. Even so, the person using, say, her cell phone to record an Obfuscated vampire will still have her mind impacted by the power, and she won&rsquo;t see the Kindred&rsquo;s image until she views the video at a later date (if even then).<br><br>Several Clans cultivate this power &mdash; the Assamites, Followers of Set, and Malkavians, for example &mdash; but the Nosferatu are particularly known for this Discipline. Some elder Kindred believe that Caine, or perhaps Lilith, bestowed the Clan with this Discipline to compensate for the hideous physical deformities its members suffer.<br><br>Most Obfuscate powers last for a scene, or until the vampire ceases maintaining them.

(The two rituals, however, are mutually exclusive.) A Splinter Servant consists of a stake carved from a tree which has nourished itself on the dead. The stake must be bound in wax-sealed nightshade twine. When the binding is torn off, the Splinter Servant leaps to life, animating itself and attacking whomever the wielder commands &mdash; or the wielder, if she is too slow in assigning a target. The servant splits itself into a roughly humanoid form and begins singlemindedly trying to impale the target&rsquo;s heart. Its exertions tear it apart within a few minutes, but if it pierces its victim&rsquo;s heart before it destroys itself, it is remarkably difficult to remove, as pieces tend to remain behind if the main portion is yanked out.</p>","details":"<p>The ritual requires 12 hours to cast, minus one per success, and the servant must be created<br>as described above.

If this command is not given, the servant attacks the closest living or unliving being, usually the unfortunate individual who currently carries it.<br><br>A Splinter Servant always aims for the heart. It has an attack dice pool of the caster&rsquo;s Wits + Occult, a damage dice pool of the caster&rsquo;s Thaumaturgy rating, and a maximum movement rate of 30 yards or meters per turn. Note that these values are those of the caster who created the servant, not the individual who activates it. A Splinter Servant cannot fly, but can leap its full movement rating every turn. Every action it takes is to attack or move toward its target; it cannot dodge or split its dice pool to perform multiple attacks. The servant makes normal stake attacks that aim for the heart (difficulty 9), and its success is judged as per the rules for a normal staking (see p. 280). A Splinter Servant has three health levels, and attacks directed against it are made at +3 difficulty due to its small size and erratic movement patterns.<br><br>A Splinter Servant has an effective life of five combat turns per success rolled in its creation. If it has not impaled its victim by the last turn of its life, the servant collapses into a pile of ordinary, inanimate splinters.

The ritual takes the normal casting time if it is to be short-term (lasting for the rest of the night) or one night if it is to be long-term (lasting a year and a day).<br><br>Once the warding circle is established, any ghoul who attempts to cross its boundary feels a tingle on his skin and a slight breeze on his face &mdash; a successful Intelligence + Occult roll (difficulty 8) identifies this as a warding circle. If the ghoul attempts to press on, he must roll more successes on a Willpower roll (difficulty of the caster&rsquo;s Thaumaturgy rating + 3) than the caster rolled when establishing the ward. Failure indicates that the ward blocks his passage and inflicts three dice of bashing damage, and his next roll to attempt to enter the circle is at +1 difficulty. If the ghoul leaves the circle and attempts to enter it again, he must repeat the roll. Attempts to leave the circle are not blocked.</p>","type":"wod.types.ritual","level":"2","value":0,"max":5,"dice1":"intelligence","dice2":"occult","bonus":0,"difficulty":"5","isrollable":true,"isactive":false,"spendwillpower":false,"spendrage":false,"spendgnosis":false,"spendblood":false,"spendglamour":false},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.SOFUQHVyXwWb4xVU"},"cf":{"id":"temp_b8aps3s6gl","path":"Disciplines#/CF_SEP/Thaumaturgy#/CF_SEP/Thaumaturgy Rituals#/CF_SEP/Level 2 Rituals","color":"#000000"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldofdarkness","systemVersion":"2.2.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1671081485306,"modifiedTime":1674439752257,"lastModifiedBy":"CZyj5tVpsqRvDFFc"},"_id":"kIJ3aOzEGVfjXZeh","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"CZyj5tVpsqRvDFFc":3}}

An ephemeral silver cord connects the Kindred&rsquo;s psyche to her body. If this cord is severed, her consciousness becomes stranded in the astral plane (the realm of ghosts, spirits, and shades). Attempting to return to the vampire&rsquo;s physical shell is a long and terrifying ordeal, especially since there is no guarantee that she will accomplish the journey successfully. This significant danger keeps many Kindred from leaving their bodies for long, but those who dare can learn much.</p>","details":"<p>Journeying in astral form requires the player to expend a point of Willpower and make a Perception + Awareness roll. Difficulty varies depending on the distance and complexity of the intended trip; 5 is within sight, 7 is nearby or to a familiar location, and 9 reflects a trip far from familiar territory (a first journey from North America to the Far East; trying to shortcut through the earth). The greater the number of successes rolled, the more focused the character&rsquo;s astral presence is, and the easier it is for her to reach her desired destination.<br><br>Failure means the character is unable to separate her consciousness from her body, while a botch can have nasty consequences &mdash; flinging her astral form to a random destination on Earth or in the spirit realm, arriving in a place where the sun is active (necessitating a frenzy roll, although the sunlight doesn&rsquo;t do any damage), or hurtling toward the desired destination so forcefully that the silver cord snaps.<br><br>The player may spend a point of Willpower to activate this power, and an additional point of Willpower to gain the success necessary to perform the jaunt. This is an exception to the normal rule where a player may not spend more than a single point of Willpower per turn.<br><br>Each scene in Psychic Projection requires another point of Willpower and a new roll. Failure indicates that the vampire has lost her way and must retrace the path of her silver cord. A botch at this stage means the cord snaps, stranding the character&rsquo;s psychic form in the mysterious astral plane.<br><br>An astral form may travel at great speeds (the Storyteller can use roughly 1000 miles per hour or 1500 kilometers per hour as a general guide) and carries no clothing or material objects of any kind. Some artifacts are said to exist in the spirit world, and the character can try to use one of these tools if she finds one. The character cannot bring such relics to the physical world when she returns to her body, however.<br><br>Interaction with the physical world is impossible while using Psychic Projection. At best, the character may spend a Willpower point to manifest as a ghostlike shape. This apparition lasts one turn before fading away; while she can&rsquo;t affect anything physically during this time, the character can speak. Despite lacking physical substance, an astral character can use Auspex normally. At the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion, such a character may employ some or all Animalism, Dementation, Dominate, Necromancy, Obtenebration, Presence, Thaumaturgy, and similar non-corporeal powers she has, though this typically requires a minimum of three successes on the initial Psychic Projection roll.<br><br>If two astral shapes encounter one another, they interact as if they were solid. They may talk, touch, and even fight as if both were in the material world. Since they have no physical bodies, astral characters seeking to interact &ldquo;physically&rdquo; substitute Mental and Social Traits for Physical ones (Wits replaces Dexterity, Manipulation supplants Strength, and Intelligence replaces Stamina). Due to the lack of a material form, the only real way to damage another psychic entity is to cut its silver cord. When fighting this way, consider Willpower points to be health levels; when a combatant loses all of her Willpower, the cord is severed.<br><br>Although an astrally projected character remains in the reflection of the mortal world, she may venture further into the spirit realms, especially if she becomes lost. Other beings with particular sensitivity to psychic activity, such as ghosts, werewolves, and even some magi, travel the astral plane as well, and can interact with a vampire&rsquo;s psychic presence normally (although the astrally projected character is not considered a &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; for powers such as Necromancy). The observing character notices the astrally projecting vampire with a Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 8), requiring more successes than the Psychic Projection activation roll. Even those who do notice you won&rsquo;t be able to identify you; you are merely an immaterial shade hovering in the general area. Storytellers are encouraged to make trips into the spirit world as bizarre, mysterious, and dreamlike as possible. The world beyond is a vivid and fantastic place, where the true nature of things is stronger and often strikingly different from their earthly appearances.</p>","type":"wod.types.disciplinepower","level":"5","value":0,"max":5,"dice1":"perception","dice2":"awareness","bonus":0,"difficulty":"-1","isrollable":true,"isactive":false,"spendwillpower":false,"spendrage":false,"spendgnosis":false,"spendblood":false,"spendglamour":false},"effects":[],"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_oqqyfie3wor","path":"Disciplines#/CF_SEP/Auspex","color":"#000000"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"worldofdarkness","systemVersion":"2.2.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1668764159874,"modifiedTime":1674221157928,"lastModifiedBy":"CZyj5tVpsqRvDFFc"},"_id":"mnjVrWwmsnINEPDd","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"CZyj5tVpsqRvDFFc":3}}

If not, the stake may be used to make subsequent attacks until it strikes deep enough to activate.<br><br>Once the tip of the stake is in the victim&rsquo;s body, the Storyteller begins an extended roll of the caster&rsquo;s Thaumaturgy rating (difficulty 9), rolling once per hour of game time. Successes on this roll are added to the successes scored in the initial attack. This represents the tip&rsquo;s progress toward the victim&rsquo;s heart. A botch indicates that the tip has struck a bone and all accumulated successes are lost (including those from the initial attack roll). Removing the part of the body where the tip impacted (such as a Tzimisce turning into blood or a vampire cutting off their arm) may stop the tip&rsquo;s progress, depending on the number of successes acquired and the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion. When the shaft accumulates a total of 15 successes, it reaches the victim&rsquo;s heart. This paralyzes Kindred and is instantly fatal to mortals and ghouls.<br><br>Attempts to surgically remove the tip of the shaft can be made with an extended Dexterity + Medicine roll made once per hour (difficulty 7 for Kindred and 8 for mortals). The surgeon must accumulate a number of successes equal to those currently held by the shaft in order to remove the tip. Once surgery begins, however, the shaft begins actively evading the surgeon&rsquo;s probes, and its rolls are made once every 30 minutes for the duration of the surgery attempt. Each individual surgery roll that scores less than three successes inflicts an additional unsoakable level of lethal damage on the patient.<br><br>Shaft of Belated Quiescence may be performed on other wooden impaling weapons, such as spears, arrows, practice swords, and pool cues, provided that they are made of rowan wood.

Halfway through the act, she learned that she had ingested a dire quantity of tainted blood and was then unable to resist the weakened hashashiyyin&rsquo;s renewed attack.</p>","details":"<p>The sorcerer version of Scorpion&rsquo;s Touch is Scorpion&rsquo;s Curse. It allows the sorcerer to place a ward on a solid surface such as a door, a section of floor, or even a small object such as a box or a letter. The sorcerer may ward any object or area up to her Intelligence dots in square yards/meters. A few seconds after the power is activated, the blood ward fades and can only be spotted with a Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 9) or a Perception + Investigation roll (difficulty 7). The ward lasts for a number of days equal to her Occult dots before dissipating, but while it lasts, anyone who touches the affected area or item is targeted by the Discipline just as though a warrior using Scorpion&rsquo;s Touch had successfully touched him.<br><br><br><em><strong>Original - Warrior Version:</strong></em><br>To convert a bit of her blood to poison, the Kindred&rsquo;s player spends at least one blood point and rolls Willpower (difficulty 6). If this roll is successful, and the vampire successfully hits (but not necessarily damages) her opponent, the target loses a number of Stamina points equal to the number of blood points converted into poison &mdash; vampires attempting to drink the blood of the Kindred with Scorpion&rsquo;s Touch are automatically considered to be &ldquo;successfully hit.&rdquo;<br><br>The victim may resist the poison with a Stamina + Fortitude roll (difficulty 6); successes achieved on the resistance roll subtract from the vampire&rsquo;s successes. The maximum number of blood points a Kindred may convert at any one time is equal to her Stamina.

If a Kindred&rsquo;s Stamina falls to zero, the vampire enters torpor and remains that way until one of her Stamina points returns. If a Kindred is permanently reduced to zero Stamina, she may recover from torpor only through mystical means.<br><br></p>\n<p>To afflict someone with the poison, the Cainite must touch her target&rsquo;s flesh or hit him with something that carries the venom. Many Assamites lubricate their weapons with the excretion, while others pool the toxin in their hands (or fleck their lips with the poison, for a &ldquo;kiss of death&rdquo;) and press it to their opponents. Weapons so envenomed must be of the melee variety &mdash; arrows, sling stones, bullets, thrown weapons, and the like cannot carry enough of the stuff to do damage, or it drips off in flight. Players whose vampires wish to spit at their targets must make a Stamina + Athletics roll (difficulty 6). No more than two blood points&rsquo; worth of poison may be expectorated, and a Kindred may spit a distance of 10 feet (3 meters) for each point of Strength (and Potence) the character possesses.

The overwhelming hunger for blood temporarily abates, allowing the character to consume and enjoy food and drink. She can also enjoy sex as she wishes, and the sun does not burn her. The Gift of Life comes with a dark, terrible cost, however. Its use is almost sure to result in the death of a mortal, as the vampire must expend an enormous quantity of vitae in order to initiate it. The Discipline&rsquo;s effects last until the midnight after the character uses the power, so it is in her best interests to use it just after midnight.occ</p>","details":"<p>The player spends 12 blood points, burning as much blood as possible each turn until she meets that level. She then rolls Stamina + Occult (difficulty 6) and needs only one success for the power to work. A botch has catastrophic effects. The character might be instantly killed or might inadvertently Embrace her victim, for example. If it takes longer than one turn to spend the necessary blood to enact this ability, it does not take effect until all 12 points have been spent. However, the blood must be spent continuously &mdash; the vampire cannot burn five, run off and feed, then burn seven more an hour later. On the other hand, she may feed as she activates the power &mdash; in one turn she might burn one blood point while drinking three. Since few Kindred above the Seventh Generation can easily expend such an amount of blood, the most efficient way to activate this power is to have a human nearby who can be sacrificed to power the transformation.<br><br>After her transformation, the character gains many traits of an ordinary human. She is largely immune to the scorching effects of the sun (Fortitude difficulties to soak damage from direct sunlight are halved, and she takes no damage if she is sufficiently covered), and she can experience and enjoy many of the fine things about human life. She retains a few of her vampiric benefits, however. Fortitude and Auspex abilities remain in place if she has either of those Disciplines, and the Storyteller may allow her to retain other Disciplines as well if he deems them dramatically appropriate. She also retains a vampire&rsquo;s benefits when it comes to handling bashing damage. However, she is still vulnerable to holy artifacts, human faith, and being staked. Her blood remains vitae, not human blood.
